## About the project

The Cambridge Gig Guide project makes use of all of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills I have learnt over the past couple of years to build a complex website. I wanted to build a centralised website that displays all of the gigs in Cambridge, instead of having to sign up to countless mailing lists or visiting each venue's website to find out what's going on. 

The site has been deployed on Heroku: https://cambridge-gig-guide.herokuapp.com/

## User cases

There are three user cases for the website:

- General visitors
- Promoters/Venue staff
- Admin 

**General visitors**

General visitors don't need any access to the site beyond what is made publicly available. This includes looking at the index page for news, newly released/announced gigs and and what gigs are coming up over the coming weeks. They will also be able to look at all of the gigs filtered by month, and look at gigs by venue too.

**Promoters/Venue staff**

Promoters and venue staff will be able to input their own gigs using a form. They will also be able to edit and delete gigs where appropriate. 

**Admin**

Administrators need to have full control of the site. Not only being able to input, edit and delete gigs, but also have control of the registration of new promoters/venue staff.

There also needs to be a contact form so users can get in contact with the administrators. Password reset functionality will also be included so that promoters/venue staff/admin can reset their passwords via a token emailed to them.
